# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION APP

This app takes sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width (all in cm) of a particular Iris flower from a user, and then based on the trained neural network model (using the dataset which can found on the link below), it predicts the type which the particular flower will belong to.
